// {FuturePlans}
- Make the taskbar close out of the dropdowns when selecting an item
- Refresh the page after creating a new post
    - The problem with using "await props.history.go(0);" is that it refreshes before the post can be made
- I made the rotation of a new post lazy (I want to upload the actual rotated image for better usage but it's been tricky)
    - Currently I have a rotation value in the firebase storage tracking it for that post
- For creating a new post make an animation to bring the polaroid closer to you and have fields to edit
    - Make the photo part have a UploadFileOutlinedIcon in the middle of it
    - Make the text have a EditOutlinedIcon beside it
    - Flip the polaroid around to edit text on the back
- Resize the image that is uploaded so it doesn't take up too much space
- View password in regular text
- Email confirmation when signing up
- Change email signin to email or username signin
- Get rid of underline where the username search is
- Darkmode
- Clean up all the functions that have open/close to just ivert the status of the value
