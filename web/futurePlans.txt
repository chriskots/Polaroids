// {FuturePlans}
- I want to reload the page data but the problem is that viewPostItem changes on the server when getting the profile but not locally
- I made the rotation of a new post lazy (I want to upload the actual rotated image for better usage but it's been tricky)
    - Currently I have a rotation value in the firebase storage tracking it for that post
- Make a add back button for adding a friend if they have already sent you a friend request
    - This would require me to pass the users profile as well as the page profile
- Figure out a way to send notifications for when you post something
    - Make it so when you click on a notification it goes to that item (comment or new post)
- For creating a new post make an animation to bring the polaroid closer to you and have fields to edit
    - Make the photo part have a UploadFileOutlinedIcon in the middle of it
    - Make the text have a EditOutlinedIcon beside it
    - Flip the polaroid around to edit text on the back
- Tactile signature
- Maybe change the dates to be 9/8/2025: 11:42 format
- Dynamically change the font sizes when the text reaches outside of the div for the h2 post titles
    - Maybe also limit the text allowed in the create new post functionality (but I would prefer them to just make the post titles smaller visually)
    - Another option is making a caption for the polaroid on the back of the polaroid (allows the user to provide more text instead of relying on the title)
- Maybe I can find a way to use redis cache to reduce calls to firebase and speed up the project
- View password in regular text (toggle)
- Email confirmation when signing up
- Change email signin to email or username signin
- Darkmode
- Clean up all the functions that have open/close to just invert the status of the value
- Allow for the user to remove comments and posts
- An option is to make the comments go to the end of the div when making a new post (but I can talk to Emily to see what she thinks)

- Right now on the homepage it refreshes the background when in the viewPostItem
    - I think this is fine and I don't think theres any way to change this because we have to store the users and friends profile posts together
